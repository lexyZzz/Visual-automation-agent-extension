"""Evaluation harness. One command, whole corpus, one report.

    python eval/harness.py                    # everything
    python eval/harness.py --only syn-gov-*   # a subset, same pipeline
    python eval/harness.py --score-only       # re-score the last run, no browser

Measures the five things the evaluation actually rewards:

  visual context accuracy   element recall against the hand-listed interactive elements
  PII recall / precision    per class, at both NER operating points, with a confusion
                            matrix and a hard-negative tally
  redaction precision       IoU against ground-truth boxes AND the over-redaction rate --
                            blacking out half a page must score badly, not well
  client resources          peak GPU memory, peak JS heap, resident model bytes, idle CPU
  end-to-end latency        per stage, p50 and p95

It reports five numbers because the rubric has five criteria. There is deliberately no
single "accuracy" figure: an aggregate that mixes recall with over-redaction is exactly
the number a team that blurs everything would want reported.

Offline throughout. The corpus is self-contained HTML served from a loopback port, and
the planner is a local recorder that returns a fixed plan -- no model is consulted,
because what is being measured here is perception and redaction, and a planner that
varied between runs would make the numbers unrepeatable.

## Loading the extension

Not `--load-extension`. Chrome 151 ignores it and
`--disable-features=DisableLoadExtensionCommandLineSwitch` does not bring it back. The
route that works is `--enable-unsafe-extension-debugging` plus the CDP
`Extensions.loadUnpacked` domain -- see runner/browser.py, and demo/LOAD-SESSION.md for
where that was established.

## activeTab, and the one thing the eval build changes

`chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab` needs `activeTab` or a matching host permission.
`activeTab` is granted only by a real toolbar click and revoked on navigation, and there
is no gesture a harness can produce that earns it -- Playwright cannot click browser
chrome, and invoking the action from script is not a user gesture.

So runner/build.py copies `dist/chrome` and widens `host_permissions` to `<all_urls>` in
the copy, recording the shipped value and the reason in the manifest itself. `describe()`
refuses to score a build that does not carry that marker, and the report prints it.

This is a real deviation and it is stated rather than hidden: the bundle under test
differs from the shipped one in exactly one field. Everything the metrics measure --
perception, detection, the gate, the boxes -- is the shipped code. Get this wrong in the
other direction and every capture fails, every manifest is empty, and every metric reads
a confident zero.
