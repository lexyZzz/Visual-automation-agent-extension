"""Scoring a run. The definitions are the deliverable, so they are spelled out here.

Five metrics, reported as five numbers. There is no aggregate "accuracy" in this file and
there must not be one: the rubric weighs visual context, detection, redaction precision,
client resources and latency separately because they trade against each other, and a
single mean would let a team hide a collapse in one behind a win in another.

Every definition below is the one from the brief, stated in enough detail that two people
would compute the same number:

  Element recall      hand-listed interactive elements present in the index / total.
                      Matched by position: a listed element counts as found when some
                      indexed element overlaps it with IoU >= MATCH_IOU. Role agreement
                      is reported beside it rather than folded into it, so "found it but
                      called it the wrong thing" stays visible.

  PII precision /     Per class, over findings the gate actually acted on. A finding is a
  recall / F1         true positive when it overlaps a ground-truth span of the same
                      class at IoU >= MATCH_IOU. One ground-truth span absorbs at most
                      one finding; extra findings over the same span are false positives,
                      because painting a thing twice is not detecting it twice.

  Redaction IoU       Mean IoU over matched (prediction, ground truth) pairs. Reported
                      with the match rate beside it, because a mean over one lucky pair
                      is not a redaction quality score.

  Over-redaction      Painted pixel area covering no ground-truth box / total painted
                      area. Measured two ways on purpose -- see over_redaction_measured
                      and over_redaction_by_class below -- because the pixels and the
                      manifest's own arithmetic ought to agree, and a report that only
                      ever asked the gate about itself could not notice when they do not.

  Latency             Per stage, p50 and p95, from the worker's own trace.

Boxes are CSS pixels of the visual viewport, origin top-left, throughout -- the one
coordinate space (CLAUDE.md invariant 2). Nothing here converts to image pixels except
the pixel diff, which says so where it does it.
