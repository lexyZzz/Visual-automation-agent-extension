"""Driving one corpus page through one perception cycle, and keeping everything it made.

The shape of a page run:

  1. Open the page in its own tab, with the viewport forced to the size the labels were
     measured at. A box is only ground truth for the layout it was measured against.
  2. Photograph the page *before* the extension touches it. That clean frame is what the
     sealed frame is diffed against later, and it is how over-redaction gets measured in
     pixels rather than inferred from the manifest's own arithmetic.
  3. Start a task. RUN_TASK is sent from an extension page, never from the worker: a
     runtime message a worker sends to itself is never delivered, because Chrome fans out
     to every extension context except the sender.
  4. Wait for the step to end, which the worker announces by writing one trace line.
  5. Take the POST the planner recorded -- findings, manifest, elements, sealed pixels --
     and the trace, and write them next to each other.

What is deliberately *not* done here is any scoring. This module produces evidence;
metrics.py decides what it means. Keeping those apart is what makes it possible to
re-score a run without re-running it, which during a tuning week is the difference
between a twenty-second loop and a twenty-minute one.
