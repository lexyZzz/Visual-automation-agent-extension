"""Serving the corpus over http, because file:// is not an option.

The extension's content script matches `http://localhost/*` and its host permissions say
the same. M4 narrowed that set deliberately -- `file:///*` was dropped -- so a corpus
page opened from disk gets no content script and the harness measures an empty page
while reporting no error at all.

Bound to `localhost` rather than `127.0.0.1` on purpose: Chrome match patterns treat the
two as different hosts, and `http://localhost/*` does not match `http://127.0.0.1/`.
Any port matches.
