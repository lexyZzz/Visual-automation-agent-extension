"""From run artefacts to report.json.

Separate from the harness because scoring must be re-runnable without re-running the
browser. During a tuning week the loop is: change a constant, re-run fifty pages once,
then re-score half a dozen ways while arguing about a definition. If those two are the
same command, the argument costs twenty minutes each time round.

Three decisions here shape every number, and each is stated in the report rather than
buried:

  Viewport-only scoring. Perception is viewport-only by design -- the extension walks
  what is on screen, and the first browser load found the Aadhaar field below the fold
  and did not see it. Ground truth below the fold is therefore counted separately, as
  `belowFold`, and not as a miss. Scoring it as a miss would report a recall failure for
  a design decision, and hide the real ones underneath it.

  Pixels scored in-viewport. Spans embedded in images/canvases (medium="pixels") are
  scored alongside DOM spans now that L3 vision/OCR is active, while continuing to be
  tracked in the pixels-only coverage bucket to avoid double-counting and preserve context.

  Two operating points, always. M5 names two NER thresholds -- 0.35 for recall, 0.7 for
  precision -- and reporting one of them is how a team quietly picks whichever flatters
  it. Both are computed. Where they are identical the report says why, rather than
  presenting two columns of the same number as though a choice had been exercised.
