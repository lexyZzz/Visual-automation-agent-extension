/**
 * The user's sentence, turned into something the device can act on.
 *
 * This module exists because of a specific failure. A user typed "fill first name with
 * leo"; the agent filled Last Name and Subject with a canned email address and never
 * touched First Name. The cause was in our own comment in the planner: it was a pure
 * function of the element list. Nothing anywhere read the goal. We had built an agent
 * that could not hear its user.
 *
 * So: parse the sentence, here, on the device, with no model. A single-field instruction
 * is not a reasoning problem -- "fill X with Y" is a grammar, and a grammar is cheaper,
 * faster and more predictable than any model that could be asked the same question.
 *
 * What this deliberately does *not* do is try hard. If a sentence does not parse it is
 * not a failure, it is an open-ended task: "book the next available appointment" has no
 * target field and no value, and belongs to the planner. Returning nothing is the right
 * answer and the caller escalates.
 *
 * ## The residue rule (M16)
 *
 * Trying-not-very-hard is only safe if the parser knows how much of the sentence it did
 * not read. It did not. `PATTERNS[0]` is anchored at the end but not at the start, so
 * `fill` matched the `fill` inside "Dont fill last name with Leo" and the four characters
 * in front of the verb -- the four that reverse the instruction -- were discarded without
 * ever being looked at. The agent filled the field it had been told not to fill, and
 * reported success.
 *
 * So every character of the instruction is now accounted for. A clause records the span a
 * pattern consumed; anything left over is *residue*; and Tier 0 may act only on a sentence
 * with **zero** residue. Not a small amount, not a tolerable fraction -- none. A threshold
 * here is a promise that the words we skipped were unimportant, and the failure above is
 * exactly the case where the skipped words were the whole meaning.
 *
 * Filler that genuinely carries nothing ("please", "can you", "now") is consumed by an
 * explicit ignore list, so it is *visibly* consumed rather than silently tolerated. The
 * difference matters: an ignore list can be read and argued with, and a threshold cannot.
 *
 * Node-pure.
