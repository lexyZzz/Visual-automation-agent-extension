/**
 * Tier 1, and every way it is allowed to decline.
 *
 * Unavailable is a normal outcome, not a failure: Ollama not running, no model pulled, a
 * request that takes too long. All of them fall through to Tier 2 rather than throwing.
 *
 * They used to be indistinguishable -- every one returned `null`, on the reasoning that the
 * caller does the same thing with each. That reasoning was wrong, and it hid something for
 * months: Ollama answers a `chrome-extension://` origin with 403, so Tier 1 had never once
 * run in a real browser, and every step log said "tier 1 declined" as though a model had
 * looked at the question. The caller does still do the same thing with each; the *operator*
 * does not, and they are the one reading the log.
