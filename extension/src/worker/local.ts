 * which is exactly why it may be shown things Tier 2 may not.
 *
 * Unavailable is a normal outcome. Ollama not running, a model not pulled, a request that
 * takes too long: none of them fail the step. They fall through to Tier 2, and the step
 * log says Tier 1 was skipped so that a slow demo is diagnosable rather than mysterious.
