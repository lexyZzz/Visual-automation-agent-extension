 * megabyte of parse on every wake for code that can never run there.

 *
 * `setPanelBehavior({openPanelOnActionClick: true})` looks like the obvious way to do
 * this and is a trap. Chrome opens the panel itself and `action.onClicked` never fires,
 * so the click is not an *invocation* of the extension and `activeTab` is never granted.
 * Everything downstream then fails on a page outside `host_permissions`, starting with
 * the content-script injection:
 *
 *     Cannot access contents of url "https://www.w3schools.com/...".
 *     Extension manifest must request permission to access this host.
 *
 * Which reads as a manifest bug and is not one. The extension had been working on exactly
 * that page the day before, through the action popup -- opening a popup *is* an
 * invocation, and that is what had been granting the permission all along.
 *
 * Handling `onClicked` ourselves restores it: the listener only exists because there is no
 * `default_popup`, firing it is an invocation, `activeTab` is granted for that tab, and
 * the handler is a user-gesture context, which is what `sidePanel.open()` requires. One
 * click, same panel, permission intact.
 *
 * Guarded rather than assumed: `chrome.sidePanel` does not exist on Firefox, where the
 * same page is reached through `sidebar_action` and the browser's own sidebar control, and
 * it does not exist on a Chrome older than 114. Neither is a reason for the worker to fail
 * to start -- every other route into the extension still works.
