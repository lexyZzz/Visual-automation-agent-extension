/**
 * The router. It is deliberately thin: it moves messages, owns the loop's state
 * machine, and will grow exactly one safety check (the receipt verification, M6).
 *
 * It persists no user data, and has no model and no page access. The distinction
 * matters: raw text does pass through here -- ObservedElements carrying field values on
 * their way to L0, INFER payloads on their way to the NER model -- because the worker
 * is the only thing that can talk to both the content script and the offscreen
 * document. It routes them and forgets them. What it writes to storage is the loop's
 * own state: a goal, a tab id, phases, timings. Never a value, never an element.
 *
 * Everything it knows is in `chrome.storage.session` behind the injected store, so a
 * terminated service worker loses nothing but its call stack.
 *
 * Its dependencies are injected so the whole thing runs in Node against a loopback bus
 * -- see router.test.ts.
