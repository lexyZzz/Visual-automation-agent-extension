/**
 * One pipeline, three tiers, chosen per step.
 *
 * There is no stub mode and no model mode. There is a question -- "what does the user want
 * done to this page?" -- and three ways to answer it, tried in order of cost:
 *
 *   Tier 0   the device answers. No model, no network, no screenshot.
 *   Tier 1   a model on the user's own machine breaks a tie between candidates.
 *   Tier 2   the remote planner, which sees only what the gate let through.
 *
 * Escalation is not failure. Most steps of a real task are open-ended and belong to Tier 2
 * on the first look; what Tier 0 buys is that "fill first name with leo" never leaves the
 * laptop, and that is the common case for the instruction a person actually types.
 *
 * The tier that decided is recorded on every step. So is the score gap Tier 0 measured,
 * because a fast path that cannot show its margin is indistinguishable from a guess.
 *
 * Node-pure: the model call and the network call are the caller's business.

 * the second would send a screenshot describing a page the agent had already changed, and
 * the planner would be reasoning about a state one action out of date.
 *
 * ## Where the block is checked, and why it goes straight past Tier 1
 *
 * The block comes first, before a single element is scored, because it is a fact about the
 * sentence and no amount of looking at the page can change it. "Dont fill last name with
 * Leo" resolves to a perfectly good element with a comfortable margin -- resolution was
 * never the problem.
 *
 * It escalates to Tier 2 and not to Tier 1, and this is a place where the built system
 * differs from what M16 asked for. Tier 1 answers exactly one question: given this shortlist
 * of candidate elements, which index? A blocked goal has no shortlist, because the thing
 * that failed was comprehension, not resolution -- there is no candidate list to hand it and
 * nothing it could say back within the one-index contract it is deliberately held to. So
 * blocked goals go to the tier that can actually read a sentence. The reason travels with
 * them, so the log says which rung was skipped and why.
