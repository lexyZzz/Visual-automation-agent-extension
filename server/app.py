"""HTTP surface for the planner.

One endpoint, POST /v1/step. It receives a screenshot that has already been through the
redaction gate plus the manifest describing what was removed, and returns typed actions
that refer to element indices and placeholders.

The server never sees a raw pixel and never sees a value. If it ever needs one, the
design is wrong.

schema.json and schema.request.json are generated from extension/src/shared/contract.ts
by `npm run schema:gen`. They are loaded, never re-declared: a second copy of the
contract is a second contract.

What the server keeps, and what it refuses to keep. A session holds placeholders and
indices -- tokens, not values, because tokens are all it ever receives. Request bodies
are never persisted and never logged. The trace records timings, sizes, action types and
outcomes; an element's name or a field's value would be user data reaching disk on the
one machine in this architecture that was never supposed to hold any.

    Which planner, from the environment. Three modes, none of them degraded:

      PLANNER=stub    REMOVED. Tier 0 took this job and does it on the device, where it
                      belongs -- see extension/src/worker/tiers.ts. A canned planner
                      sitting on the server pretending to be a model was never the fast
                      path; it was a placeholder that could not read the user's request at
                      all, and it filled the wrong fields for exactly that reason. Set
                      explicitly, it now fails rather than silently serving canned plans.
      PLANNER=ollama  the same model family on a laptop, over Ollama's OpenAI-compatible
                      endpoint. Local -- invariant 1 holds exactly as it does for vLLM.
                      Two models, routed per step; see below.
      PLANNER=vlm     the target: Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct on vLLM with xgrammar. Default,
                      so a misconfigured deployment fails loudly rather than quietly
                      serving stub plans.

    The two model modes differ by base URL, model name and timeout. Ollama loads weights
    on the first request after an idle period, which is tens of seconds on a cold start
    and nothing at all afterwards, so its ceiling is generous where vLLM's is tight.

    ## Two models under Ollama, one under vLLM

    A step whose page the DOM fully describes needs no vision tower, and on a laptop that
    is the difference between a demo and a stopwatch. Measured here, no CUDA, on this
    project's own recorded steps: `qwen3:0.6b` at 522 MB answered 4 of 4 with valid,
    in-range plans at a 9.6 s median; the 4B vision model on the same text-only prompts is
    an order of magnitude slower. `needs_image` decides, once, in the request handler, and
    RoutingPlanner follows that decision rather than re-deriving it.

    vLLM serves one model per container and has the GPU to make the vision tower cheap, so
    it stays single. Setting OLLAMA_VISION_MODEL to an empty string collapses the routing
    back to one model, which is what to do when only one has been pulled.
