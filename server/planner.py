"""Prompt construction, response handling, and the stub that unblocks the client.

Two planners live here and they share a validator:

    StubPlanner   canned, schema-valid actions. No GPU, no model, no network. It exists
                  so M9 is never blocked waiting for hardware -- the executor does not
                  care what produced a plan, only that it validates.
    VlmPlanner    Qwen3-VL-Instruct through vLLM's OpenAI-compatible API, with guided
                  decoding against the generated schema.

The system prompt is the interesting part. Everything else in this project is machinery
for producing a payload the planner can reason about; this is where that payload has to
actually land.

# ── The system prompt ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You operate a web page through a privacy-preserving browser agent.

You never receive raw user data. Sensitive values are replaced by placeholders of the \
form <<CLASS_N>> before anything reaches you. Numbering is stable across steps: \
<<PERSON_1>> on step 2 is the same person as <<PERSON_1>> on step 9.

The redaction manifest lists every value that was removed, its class, and which detector \
removed it. Read it before deciding a field needs filling.

Each element carries a `filled` state. Three cases, and they are different:
  filled=false, no value              the field is empty; fill it if the task needs it
  filled=true, value="<<EMAIL_1>>"    the field is filled, and that token can be reused
  filled=true, no value               the field is filled with something not tokenised; \
leave it alone

A manifest finding with mode="keep" was detected but deliberately left visible, because \
the detector was not confident. Treat it as ordinary page content.

An element marked `hidden` is on the page but not displayed. Error and status messages \
are listed before they appear so you can see what the page is prepared to say; a hidden \
one has not been said yet. Never treat a hidden status message as something that has \
happened.

To put a known value into a field, emit its placeholder as the text. The device \
substitutes the real value locally. <<SECRET_*>> cannot be used this way -- if a password \
or one-time code is required, emit an `ask` action explaining what the user must do.

A FACE finding is a photograph of a person, blurred rather than blacked out so you can \
still see that the page carries one. It has no placeholder and nothing to type: a face is \
a region, not a value.

Refer to elements by the integer index in square brackets. Elements marked * are new \
since the previous step. Elements shown without an index are visual-only and can only be \
reached by coordinate.

## Multi-step tasks

Many tasks span multiple pages. Keep `done: false` until the entire goal is complete.

Action types available to you:
  navigate  open a URL in the current tab. This is always the last action in a batch,
            because the page changes and you will perceive it fresh on the next step.
  type      type text into a field. Set submit=true to press Enter after.
  click     click a button, link, or any element by its index.
  select    choose an option in a native <select>.
  scroll    scroll the page (dy>0 = down) or scroll an element into view (index=).
  key       press a keyboard key, e.g. "Enter", "Escape", "Tab".
  wait      pause for up to 10 seconds (use sparingly — prefer settling).
  ask       stop and ask the user for something you cannot do (e.g. a password).
  finish    end the task. Use status=success when done, status=blocked when stuck.

Navigation rule: emit `navigate` as the sole or last action. The next step will \
perceive the new page. Never chain two navigates in one batch.

Scrolling rule: if the element you need is not in the current element list, emit \
a scroll action first. The next step will perceive the updated viewport.

Completion rule: emit `done: true` only when every part of the goal is finished. \
An unfinished sub-goal means `done: false`, even if one part succeeded.

Information extraction & reading tasks:
When asked to check, read, find, or show information (e.g. "show the most liked comment", "find the price of X", "read the summary"):
1. If the required information or section is not visible in the element list, scroll down (e.g. dy=800) with `done: false`.
2. Once the relevant information is visible, answer by emitting a `finish` action with status="success" and summary containing the complete answer, and set `done: true`.

Plan one step at a time. Emit at most four actions, and stop at any action whose result \
you cannot predict -- a click that navigates is the last action in a batch.

Respond only with the provided JSON schema.

    Does this step need the picture at all?

    Most steps on an ordinary form do not: the DOM has already done the perception, and
    the element list says everything the planner will use. The image earns its place only
    when something on screen is *not* accounted for by the element list.

    ## What "not accounted for" means, and what it used to mean

    This asked whether any element had no `index`, and that was right until M3b. M3b added
    a third admission class -- text-bearing blocks, which carry a page's prose and are the
    only reason a displayed Aadhaar number is ever detected. Those are deliberately
    unindexed: they are content, not controls, and nothing can click one. But their text
    is right there in `name`, so they are *described* as completely as anything on the
    page.

    The consequence was not subtle and it was invisible from either end. Measured over the
    ten replica pages in eval/report/runs: 10 out of 10 asked for the image, 22 to 56
    unindexed elements apiece, and **not one** of them anything but `text` or `heading`.
    The fast path -- a headline claim about this design, and the thing that makes a
    text-only model viable at all -- had never once fired.

    So the question is asked properly now: is there something on screen whose content the
    list cannot carry?

      an element recovered from pixels     L3 read it, so the DOM did not have it
      an L3 finding                        same, from the detection side
      an unnamed image, canvas or video    pixels with no text anywhere to describe them

    A named `<img>` is excluded on purpose: its alt text is the description, and that is
    exactly the case the accessibility tree exists to serve. An unnamed one is a
    photograph, a scanned document, a chart -- and no amount of DOM will say what is in it.

    It used to click the first button it found, which on the demo's own page A is

    """
    Qwen3-VL-Instruct over an OpenAI-compatible /chat/completions endpoint.

    The planner is a VLM and cannot be a text-only model: the image is attached exactly
    when something on screen is not in the element list, and a model without vision input
    fails those steps at the backend ("Multimodal data provided, but model does not
    support multimodal requests"). A text model like `qwen3:0.6b` is only good enough for
    fast-path DOM-only steps -- measure, don't assume. If a step ever needs the picture,
    serve a vision model (`qwen3-vl:4b`).

    Two deployments speak that protocol and both are supported, because they answer
    different questions:

      vLLM     the target. A GPU, the full 4B-Instruct weights, xgrammar doing the
               guided decoding. What the submission runs on.
      Ollama   the same model family on a laptop, and the reason the prompt can be
               exercised at all before GPU time is available. Local, so invariant 1
               holds exactly as it does for vLLM: no hosted API, ever.

    The protocol really is the same -- base URL and model name are the difference -- so
    this is one class with two configurations rather than two classes with one
    difference. `name` exists so /health says which is answering, because "the plans got
    worse" and "the backend changed" must never look alike from outside.

    Instruct, never Thinking: this asks for a short structured plan, and a reasoning
    trace is tokens paid for and thrown away. Guided decoding against the generated
    schema is not optional -- server/check_guided_decoding.py verifies the grammar
    compiles and accepts every action shape before any of this runs. Verified against
    Ollama too: the nine-branch oneOf is honoured there, and a 0.6B model that gets the
    plan wrong still cannot get the *shape* wrong.

    "Instruct, never Thinking" turned out to be a requirement rather than a preference,
    and the two deployments enforce it differently. vLLM is pointed at the Instruct
    weights, which do not think. Ollama publishes `qwen3-vl:4b` as the *thinking*
    variant, and on the first real run it spent all 512 completion tokens reasoning,
    returned empty content, and the step died on a JSONDecodeError -- a model failure
    that arrives looking like a transport bug.

    `reasoning_effort: "none"` is what Ollama honours (measured: reasoning falls to zero
    and generation gets *faster*). `think: false` is not accepted on the OpenAI-compatible
    endpoint and makes it worse -- it ran to the token ceiling. So the setting lives in
    `extra_body`, per backend, rather than being sent to both and hoped for.

    Two models, and one question decides between them: does this step need to see?

    ## Why two

    A step's prompt is 1.2-1.7 k tokens of element list and its answer is fifty tokens of
    JSON. Nothing about that needs vision -- unless the page is showing something the DOM
    cannot describe, which is precisely what `needs_image` is for. Serving those two
    cases from one 4B vision model means every ordinary form step pays for a vision tower
    it does not use.

    Measured on this project's own recorded steps, on a laptop with no CUDA:

        qwen3:0.6b       522 MB   median  9.6 s   4/4 schema-valid, indices real
        qwen3-vl:4b      3.3 GB   see server/README.md -- minutes, on the same prompts

    On a GPU both are fast and the argument is about resident bytes instead: 522 MB
    against 3.3 GB, on the path that runs almost every step.

    ## Why this is not the "two resident models" trade it looks like

    `needs_image` used to be true on every step, so a reader could reasonably conclude
    that routing buys nothing and costs a second model in memory. It was true on every
    step because it was wrong -- it counted unindexed text blocks as unexplained pixels.
    Fixed, it is false on every DOM page in the corpus, which turns the arithmetic around:
    the vision model is not a second resident model, it is one that is *not loaded* until
    a page actually shows something only a picture can carry. Ollama unloads on its own
    keep-alive, so the steady state on a form is the small model alone.

    ## Why the decision is not made here

    `app.py` already asked, and already dropped the image when the answer was no. Asking
    again would be a second copy of a rule that decides what crosses the network, and two
    copies of that rule is one more than this project can defend. So: an image means the
    step needed one.
